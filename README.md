Scripts for kernel
===========

- For use regen.sh change example_defconfig to your phone model and run

./regen.sh -r for a clean defconfig or ./regen.sh -rf for a complete defconfig.


- For use build.sh change example_defconfig to your phone model and run ./build.sh and good luck

OBS: Check if your kernel supports dtb or .gz before starting the compilation, as the default is dtb.
